/*Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements

If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

let result = "";
switch (val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}

Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:
1-3 - Low
4-6 - Mid
7-9 - High

Note: You will need to have a case statement for each number in the range.*/

function sequentialSizes(val) {
    let answer = "";
    // Only change code below this line
    switch (val) {
        case 1:
        case 2:
        case 3:
            answer = "Low";
            break;
        case 4:
        case 5:
        case 6:
            answer = "Mid";
            break;
        case 7:
        case 8:
        case 9:
            answer = 'High';
            break;
    }
    // Only change code above this line
    return answer;
}

sequentialSizes(1);

console.log(sequentialSizes(2)); //Low
console.log(sequentialSizes(5)); //Mid
console.log(sequentialSizes(7)); //High
